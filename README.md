# var2lit
Variant-to-literature batch tool for retrieving bibliographic metadata (titles, abstracts, PMIDs, etc.) using LitVar and NCBI APIs, based on genetic variant identifiers (e.g., rsIDs, HGVS).

---

## Overview

`var2lit` streamlines the process of retrieving literature metadata for genetic variants by automating batch queries using the **LitVar API** and **NCBI Entrez API**.  
It helps users bypass the one-by-one search limitations of the LitVar website and enables faster access to variant-linked article titles, abstracts, publication dates, and PMIDs.

This tool is particularly useful for:
- Researchers performing variant annotation
- Genomics analysts working on literature curation
- Anyone needing to programmatically link variants to scientific publications

---

## Key Features

- **Batch input** of multiple variant identifiers (rsIDs, HGVS)
- **Retrieves** titles, abstracts, PMIDs, publication dates
- **Outputs** structured results (e.g., CSV)
- Built with Python and designed to run in Jupyter or CLI
- Extensible for downstream NLP, annotation, or visualization

---

## Example Input

A simple list of variant identifiers:
rs781394307
rs766444643


---

## Example Output

| Variant ID | PMID | Title | Abstract | Publication Date |
|------------|------|-------|----------|------------------|
| rs781394307 | 33546694 | BMC biology | Abstract content here... | 2021 |
| rs766444643 | 33546694 | BMC biology | Abstract content here... | 2021 |
